# Release Notes Anchorman v0.9.5

## Summary

Removes dependency on Github markdown gem which had some old dependencies that didn't play well with Travis. Replaced with
API call to Github to convert markdown to HTML.

## Changes

* Remove the GitHub markdown gem, which is a native gem, and instead use Octokit to convert the markdown. Note that Octokit takes the context for converting SHA links, and so there's a lot more work in this commit.
